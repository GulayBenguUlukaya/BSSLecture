### Question 1
#### Part A
Below is the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix ùê∂ = (5 1;1 2) by mathematical derivation. 
The first image shows the calculation of eigenvalues of this matrix to be 1.6972 and 5.3028.
The second image shows the calculation of eigenvectors of this matrix to be [-(-3+sqrt(13))/2 1] and (3+sqrt(13))/2 1]. 
These are the null space vectors derived from each eigenvalue of this matrix.

#### Part B
Below is the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix ùê∂ = (5 1;1 2) by MATLAB function eig().
The columns of V present eigenvectors of A. The diagonal matrix D contains eigenvalues.

From the diagonal matrix D, we can visually confirm that the manual and MATLAB computations of the two eigenvalues are equal to be 1.6972 and 5.3028.
However, we need to confirm that the eigenvectors from MATLAB, [0.2898 -0.9571] and [-0.9571 -0.2898], are within the null space vectors that are manually calculated. The confirmation is below:

From this calculation, we can conclude that the MATLAB calculated eigenvectors are within the manually calculated null space vectors.

### Question 2
#### Part A
I have manipulated the Ex02 m. file to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix ùê∂ = (5 1;1 2) by using the Power Method.
The screenshot of the edited script is below:

The result is below:

From this calculation, we can conclude that by using the Power Method with 100 iterations calculated eigenvectors, [0.2898 -0.9571] and [-0.9571 -0.2898], and eigenvalues, 1.6972 and 5.3028, are the same as the eig() function.

#### Part B
I have manipulated the Ex02 m. file to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix ùê∂ = (5 1;1 2) by using the Power Method.
The screenshot of the edited script is below:

The resulting leading eigenvalue and two entries of the principal vector for each of the first 20 iterations of the Power Method are in a table below:

Plot of the leading eigenvalue and two entries of the principal vector for each of the first 20 iterations of the Power Method are plotted below:

### Question 3
#### Part A
I have revised (by change of parameters or input signals and adding comments) and rerun the MATLAB sample m-files Ex01 to Ex05 from the BSS lecture repository.
The edited m-files Ex01 to Ex05 are commited to this fork.
